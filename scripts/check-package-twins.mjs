/**
 * check-package-twins.mjs — a capability collapsed into an `@ai-matrx/*`
 * package must never re-grow a local definition in a consumer repo.
 *
 * THE CLASS. Arman's standing order for the client-package campaign: *"the
 * logic of the packages is NEVER duplicated outside of the package — the logic
 * all needs to live inside the packages."* Every collapse the campaign has run
 * (data, diff, print, agents, realtime, icons, kit) deleted a host twin. The
 * failure mode is not the first twin — it is the SECOND one, written months
 * later by an agent that never saw the package export, which then drifts,
 * accumulates its own bug fixes, and cancels the package's out. The census of
 * what has already been collapsed is
 * `/projects/npm-package-extraction/DUPLICATION-CENSUS.md` (common-docs).
 *
 * THE RULE. `scripts/package-twins.json` names every export that has been
 * collapsed. A top-level `function <name>` / `const <name> =` / `class <name>`
 * in this repo's tracked TypeScript, for any registered name, is a twin and
 * fails this guard — unless that exact file is in the row's `allow` list with a
 * written reason (an allowlist entry means "provably a DIFFERENT capability",
 * never "we know, we will fix it later").
 *
 * …OR in the row's `census` list, which is the OTHER thing (added 2026-09-12).
 * The shape lanes have had `shapeCensus` — loud every run, ratcheted so it can
 * only shrink — since they were built, and the NAME lane had no such list at
 * all: a body that genuinely IS the capability but cannot be collapsed in this
 * session had exactly one place to go, `allow`, which is silent and means
 * something else. That is the abuse an adversarial review caught on the byte
 * shape lane, and the name lane had no honest alternative to offer. It does
 * now: same contract, same ratchet, same rule — `census` is never an exemption,
 * it is a debt that is READ OUT every run and may only get smaller.
 *
 * AN OPTION-FIXING WRAPPER IS A DECLARED NON-FINDING, and this is the standing
 * ruling rather than a concession: a local function that BINDS the package
 * function's options and delegates in a line or two
 * (`const formatDuration = (s) => formatDurationSeconds(s, { style: "coarse" })`)
 * holds no copy of the capability — change the package and every wrapper
 * changes with it — so it is the sanctioned adapter and needs no register
 * entry. A re-implemented BODY is a twin, always. (The ALIAS lane below is a
 * different question: it asks what FLOWS INTO a wrapper, not whether the
 * wrapper may exist.)
 *
 * Portable by construction: pure Node stdlib, no install, no repo-specific
 * import. Copy it plus its JSON register into matrx-extend / matrx-local /
 * matrx-games unchanged.
 *
 * THE SHAPE LANES (added 2026-09-11). The name register has a hole its own
 * census named: a twin under an UNREGISTERED name is invisible. Byte-size
 * formatting proved it — `formatFileSize` was registered and clean, while 134
 * live byte-size bodies sat in 67 files under `formatBytes`, `fmtBytes`,
 * `humanSize`, `bytesHuman`, `formatSize`, and as bare inline JSX that is not a
 * definition at all. Durations proved it a second time the same day — all four
 * `formatDuration*` exports registered and clean, while aidream's dashboard
 * carried seven `fmtMs` / `fmtMsSummary` bodies. So a second KIND of lane
 * matches the SHAPE of a capability rather than its spelling. Each lane is a
 * module beside this one (`scripts/byte-size-shape.mjs`,
 * `scripts/duration-shape.mjs`) carrying the pattern, the reason a lookalike
 * (`80 * 1024 * 1024`, `TIMEOUT_MS = 30 * 1000`) can never match it, and a
 * self-test that plants a body. Adding a shape rule is one entry in
 * `SHAPE_RULES` below plus its module — never a new lane of copied code.
 *
 * TWO LISTS, TWO MEANINGS, on the shape rule's register row:
 *   `shapeAllow`  — provably NOT this capability (byte arithmetic feeding a
 *                   form field, say). Silent. Same rule as `allow`: never
 *                   "we know, we will fix it later".
 *   `shapeCensus` — pre-existing bodies that ARE this capability and have not
 *                   been collapsed yet. NOT an exemption: reported loudly every
 *                   run, and RATCHETED — a census entry whose file no longer
 *                   has a finding FAILS, so the list can only shrink. Same
 *                   contract as `scripts/client-hard-delete-allowlist.json`.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   default     — advisory: loud report, exit 0
 *   --strict    — exit 1 on any re-grown twin (the release-gate mode)
 *   --self-test — plant a twin in memory and prove this guard reports it
 *                 (a guard that cannot fail is not a guard) — every lane

 * THE OWNING PACKAGE'S OWN SOURCE — the one legitimate definition (2026-09-12).

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until a third adversarial review, every ROOT this guard ran
 * in was a CONSUMER app, so `git ls-files` never reached `aidream/apps/shared/`
 * — the `@ai-matrx/*` packages themselves, ~937 tracked TS files, and the very
 * place this class was first found duplicated BETWEEN packages. The packages
 * directory is now the seventh root, and in it the register's own statements
 * become checkable: `formatFileSize` really is defined in `kit/src/format.ts`,
 * and every one of the 119 collapsed names really is defined in its package's
 * `src/`. Those definitions are the THING, not twins of it.
 *
 * WHY A MAP IN THE REGISTER RATHER THAN 121 `allow` ENTRIES. An `allow` list is
 * per-file and never ratchets, so 121 hand-written exemptions would rot into a
 * list nobody can audit — and the first thing to rot would be the exemption
 * that is supposed to be narrow. WHY NOT DERIVE THE DIRECTORY FROM THE PACKAGE
 * NAME, either: `@ai-matrx/agents` lives in `matrx-agents/`, so a name-to-path
 * guess is wrong on the first package you try it on, and a guess that is wrong
 * SILENTLY grants an exemption to the wrong directory. So the mapping is DATA:
 * one `ownedBy` block in that root's register, `@ai-matrx/<pkg>` → the path
 * prefix that package's source actually occupies, written once and readable.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT HIDE, which is the whole point: the prefix is the OWNER's, so
 * `media/src/viewers/chrome.tsx` re-growing `formatFileSize` is still a finding
 * — a package duplicating another package is the worst form of this class and
 * the reason this root exists. A consumer repo's register has no `ownedBy` key
 * at all, so nothing about the other six roots changes.

 * runs there, so in a consumer repo's own gate the loss was invisible. Both
 * commits ran `--self-test` and `--strict` and both were green.

 * THE ALIAS LANE (2026-09-12, the sixth adversarial review).

 * input lane (`format-input-shape.mjs`) asks what ENTERS `formatFileSize`, and
 * it hunts that spelling — so `export { formatFileSize as fmtBytes }` in an
 * inspector barrel took ~31 call sites out of the guard in one line, and

 * round replaced a local byte-size body with `function formatBytes(n) { return
 * formatFileSize(n); }` and KEPT THE NAME, converting a body the shape lane
 * caught into an input nothing looked at — and the very next line handed it a
 * character count.
 *

 *   `import { X as Y } from "@ai-matrx/…"`,

 *
 * WHAT IS NOT A FINDING, deliberately: a wrapper that adds real logic (a
 * fallback word, a bound option applied to a TRANSFORMED input, a type guard)
 * is a different capability under a different name — it is judged by the
 * ordinary name lane, not this one. An alias whose module is NOT an
 * `@ai-matrx/*` specifier is renaming a LOCAL binding (a repo's own styled
 * `ResizableHandle`), which is not this class. And `allow` / `census` mean

 * every guard that judges the export still sees its spelling on the line. This
 * lane briefly matched that form and went red over
 * `features/agent-comparison/components/RunsComparisonTable.tsx`, which
 * imports `formatFileSize` from the package on line 22 and passes it as a
 * column's `format` — correct, idiomatic usage. THE LINE IS REBINDING vs
 * PASSING: a finding needs a NEW NAME BOUND to the capability
 * (`const Y = X`, `import { X as Y }`, `export { X as Y }`, `NAME: (a) => X(a)`,
 * `function Y(a) { return X(a); }`). Passing the export as a value binds
 * nothing.
 *
 * THE SAME DECLARED LIMIT AS THE WRAPPER LANE: an ADAPTER is not a finding.
